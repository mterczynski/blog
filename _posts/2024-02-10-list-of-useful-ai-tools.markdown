There are many AI tools available - I've made a short list of those I find the most useful, here they are:

- <img width=30 height=30 src="/blog/assets/chatgpt.webp"> [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - a great and free tool for generating funny poems, generating answers to specific code problems, getting quick (though not reliable) answers to legal issues
- <img width=30 height=30 src="/blog/assets/soundraw.png"> [Soundraw](https://soundraw.io/) - a great and free tool for generating sound themes for games and videos
- <img width=30 height=30 src="/blog/assets/copilot.jpg"> [Bing Copilot Designer](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GENEXP) - a neat free tool for generating images with 15 free daily generations
