Many AI tools have emerged in the past 2 years. I've tried a few of them and made a short list of those I found the most useful, here they are:

- <img width=30 height=30 src="/blog/assets/ai-tools/chatgpt.webp"> [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is one of the most useful AI tools available (and it's free too!). It's use cases range from generating answers to specific code problems, crafting marketing slogans, getting quick (though not reliable) answers to legal issues, to writing jokes or generating alternative endings to your favorite stories. It has a huge amount of many different kinds of use cases, many yet undiscovered.

The tool supports many different languages and can be used to quickly add subtitles to short videos for your's business social media (like YouTube Shorts, TikTok)

Each generation produces up to 4 images. This tool has many use cases - creating artwork, posters, advertisements, Slack avatars, brand logos and pretty much any image that can be imagined (however absurd).
